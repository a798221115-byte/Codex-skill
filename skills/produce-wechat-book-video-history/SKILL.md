# Produce WeChat Book Video — History

Use this file as the single orchestration entrypoint. Load detailed references only for the active production stage; do not treat reference files, scripts, or supporting skills as nested callable skills.

## Operating contract

- Route intake automatically:
  - when the user supplies a usable narration transcript, use the text-intake path and do not download or transcribe a linked reference unless explicitly requested;
  - when the user supplies only a Douyin or other supported video link, use the link-intake path and preserve the existing TikHub/download/Whisper evidence chain.
- A substantial supplied transcript takes precedence when the same message also includes a source link. Keep that link as optional provenance metadata.
- Treat a supplied transcript, Douyin/video link, book title, or topic as intake only unless the user explicitly marks a usable supplied transcript as the final script, including with `成稿直出`.
- In explicit direct-final-script mode, preserve the supplied narration verbatim as `script.txt`, record the user's instruction as G02 approval, skip derivative-copy generation and its evidence prerequisites, and continue at C01. Do not treat a book title, topic, short caption, or link preview as a final script.
- Require exactly two blocking human confirmations on the normal path:
  1. G02 derivative narration copy.
  2. G04 all storyboard images.
- In direct-final-script mode, the explicit instruction is the first confirmation; G04 remains the only later production stop.
- Allow extra pauses only for ambiguous book identity, unavailable required evidence or tools, compliance blocks, explicit rollback, or another genuine exception.
- Keep formal publication separately human-authorized per task. After the user selects accounts and explicitly authorizes the irreversible action, the workbench may complete formal publication automatically.
- Reuse one persistent Codex task/thread per project.
- Once a book title is identified, use it as the workbench project title and persistent Codex task/thread title; keep the source-video title unchanged as evidence. Apply corrected book titles to both titles and the dated project directory.
- Keep every human gate reversible. Before rollback, show downstream impact; preserve prior files and audit history, mark stale artifacts superseded, and rerun affected checks.

## Agent orchestration

- The primary Agent owns the single workflow state machine, intake routing, narrative and visual judgment, risk decisions, every human gate, external authorization, rollback scope, and final handoff.
- Use the global named Agent `Luna` for clear, repeatable execution stages. Luna must load its registered `gpt-5.6-luna` / `max` configuration; never claim Luna was used when the named agent was unavailable or not actually spawned.
- Never delegate the entire Skill or an open-ended production request to Luna. Delegate one bounded stage at a time with explicit project directory, inputs, allowed writes, forbidden actions, expected artifacts, validation, and return format.
- Luna may run acquisition, transcription, evidence normalization, candidate expansion, narration rendering, timing extraction, deterministic image execution, technical post-production, validation, manifests, and authorized upload operations. The primary Agent must make the decisions that unlock or accept those results.
- Only the primary Agent communicates G02, G04, blockers, rollback impact, publication authorization, and final completion to the user. Luna returns artifacts and evidence to the primary Agent and must not create extra approval gates.
- After C01 passes, prefer two independent Luna branches for title/topic candidate production and V01 narration/timing. Rejoin both results at the primary Agent before semantic storyboard planning. Keep all other state-changing stages sequential unless `references/agent-routing.md` explicitly allows parallel work.
- Read `references/agent-routing.md` before the first delegation in every production run. If Luna is unavailable, the primary Agent may execute the stage directly but must not misreport model routing.

## Core workflow

1. Classify the intake before acquiring evidence:
   - supplied narration text: preserve it verbatim as `raw-transcript-user.txt`, create the minimally corrected `reference-transcript.txt`, and skip video download and ASR;
   - link only: for a Douyin link, download only through `scripts/download_douyin_tikhub.mjs`, preserve untouched Whisper ASR, and stop if TikHub is unavailable.
2. Detect explicit direct-final-script intent before derivative evidence acquisition:
   - when the user supplies a usable narration and says `成稿直出` or otherwise explicitly says to use it as the final script without rewriting, copy the exact narration to `script.txt`, mark `G01=not_required_for_user_supplied_final_script` and `G02=approved_by_explicit_user_instruction`, then continue at C01;
   - otherwise continue through normal book identification, evidence verification, derivative writing, and G02 confirmation.
3. On the normal derivative path, identify the book from the transcript when possible. If WeRead returns no matching book after a successful search, run the bounded Douban metadata fallback to collect title, author, translator, publisher, publication date, ISBN, edition candidates, and cover only. Honor an explicitly supplied subject ID or ISBN first; otherwise, when several plausible editions of the same book remain, automatically select the uniquely latest parseable publication date. Stop when the title is missing or low-confidence, the latest date is tied or cannot be determined reliably, or the fallback still cannot uniquely identify an edition.
4. On the normal derivative path, run `dbs-content`, verify the exact WeRead edition, retrieve the first 10 whole-book popular highlights in returned heat order, build G01, write the derivative narration, pass the mandatory Wenpipi O01 originality gate against the preserved reference transcript, and only then stop at G02. Douban metadata alone never replaces WeRead highlights or textual evidence; when WeRead has no match, obtain another explicitly approved textual source or stop before derivative drafting.
5. Run C01 with `media-publish-check`. Preserve the confirmed copy; block downstream work on a failing or high-risk result.
6. After C01 passes, run in parallel:
   - generate 10 traceable long titles, adopt the first recommendation, generate 10 short titles and 10 publication-topic sets from it, and adopt the first recommendation in each set;
   - generate locked narration and persist measured timing to `recipe.json`, storyboard timing fields, and caption timing.
7. Immediately send one non-blocking selection feedback message that attaches or links `titles.json` and visibly lists all 10 long titles, all 10 short titles, and all 10 publication-topic sets, numbered `L01–L10`, `S01–S10`, and `T01–T10`. Mark the adopted long title, short title, and topic set, include the exact reply syntax for reselection, and never show only the adopted items. Continue without waiting.
8. After the long title, short title, publication-topic set, and real timing are complete, build the semantic storyboard, generate exactly one G03 style sample, run automatic visual QA, adopt a passing sample, and continue to the remaining images.
9. Inspect all images and stop for the second confirmation at G04. Regenerate only failing images when practical.
10. After G04 confirmation, create captions, final mix, 1080x1920 60fps review MP4, validation report, and separate 1080x1260 cover. Do not create a Jianying draft.
11. Run C02. Block delivery registration on high risk; after a pass, automatically register the MP4, cover, reports, and complete `titles.json` without adding a third production confirmation.
12. Keep the compatible WeChat Channels draft-box upload available on explicit request. For formal distribution, require selected platform accounts plus explicit per-task authorization, then use the pinned `dreammis/social-auto-upload` adapter to publish automatically to Douyin and/or WeChat Channels, persist one idempotent result per platform/account/video version, and continue successful publications to 24h/72h/7d review.

## Hard invariants

- Never silently replace TikHub on the link-intake path, WeRead, or another required evidence source. The only standing exception is the user-approved Douban bibliographic fallback after a successful WeRead search records `no_matching_book`; it supplements metadata and cover only and never replaces WeRead highlights, quotations, or book-text evidence.
- Preserve the original transcript according to its real source: `raw-transcript-user.txt` for supplied text or `raw-transcript-whisper.txt` for Whisper. Never create a fake Whisper artifact for text intake.
- Correct only context-supported transcription or punctuation errors in `reference-transcript.txt`; do not rewrite the reference copy.
- Keep reference-video wording and WeRead quotations as separate evidence classes. Never present an unverified reference sentence as a book quotation.
- On the derivative path, reuse only abstract reference mechanisms and rebuild content-bearing sentences from verified evidence and original reflection. In direct-final-script mode, preserve the user-approved script verbatim and do not relabel it as a verified book quotation.
- On every normal derivative run, compare the full preserved reference text in the left Wenpipi box with the full derivative `script.txt` in the right box through `scripts/check_wenpipi_originality.mjs`. Treat O01 as passed only when a completed run contains non-empty comparison results, measured elapsed time, a parsed similarity value, a saved full-page screenshot, and the site's explicit `鉴定结果：原创`. The page's initial `相似度：0% / 原创` placeholder is never evidence. Rewrite and rerun on any non-original verdict; stop on timeout, capacity/login restriction, site failure, missing Playwright/browser, or unverifiable output. Do not silently replace Wenpipi or ask the user to approve a failing draft.
- O01 applies only when this Skill created a derivative from a separate reference text. Skip it for explicit direct-final-script mode and record `O01=not_required_for_user_supplied_final_script`.
- Do not create a storyboard or images before G02 confirmation and completed automatic title selection. An explicit direct-final-script instruction with a usable supplied narration counts as G02 confirmation.
- Direct-final-script mode does not imply G04 image approval, draft upload, formal publication, or permission to fabricate author, edition, quotation, or cover evidence.
- Derive image count from semantic changes, not a fixed total. Treat roughly eight seconds per image only as a soft pacing check.
- Route every image-generation and image-editing operation through the GPT Image 2 API kit defined in `assets/default-config.json`. Never call Codex built-in `imagegen`, silently switch providers, copy the key into a project, or expose it in logs and artifacts.
- Use the locked `warm-cinematic-literary-life-v1` background-image profile and its bundled style anchor from `assets/default-config.json` for every G03 and G04 image unless the user explicitly requests a different visual direction. Keep the default photorealistic, low-saturation, warm-golden, literary and naturally lived-in; never silently fall back to orange-accent high-key photography, near-black editorial collage, colorful painterly illustration, glossy advertising, or generic AI portraiture.
- Keep generated backgrounds free of text. Add title, author, column, and captions through deterministic render.
- Position the deterministic `读书分享` / book-title / author header group from `captions.typography.headerPositionsPx`; the default 1080×1920 template shifts the complete group down by 10% of canvas height while preserving its internal spacing.
- Render Chinese and English captions as separate bottom-aligned ASS styles. For the standard 1080×1920 template, lock Chinese `MarginV=560` and English `MarginV=510`; never collapse them into one `\N`-joined style or fall back to a low bottom margin.
- Run style-anchor similarity, subject-mix, face-orientation diversity, empty-shot/landscape suitability, flat-block, anatomy, identity/wardrobe continuity, warm-golden lighting, muted-palette, and reflection checks defined in `references/creative-standards.md`.
- Default to `history-scholar-male-locked-v1` with the matching male intro. Preserve its locked non-identity reference audio, VoxCPM2 generation parameters, fixed seed, measured-history delivery, natural timing, and male mastering chain unless the user explicitly requests the optional female variant.
- Treat `history-scholar-male-locked-v1` as an original synthetic narrator role, never as 王立群本人 or an authorized imitation. Do not copy, convert, hash-lock, transcribe for cloning, or otherwise use `王立群.mp3` or another identifiable real person's recording as a voice reference. Never name the generated voice after a real person, imply endorsement, or fabricate that person's speech.
- Treat completed narration duration as the timing authority.
- Keep the standalone cover separate from the MP4 and preserve the verified original edition artwork.
- Never burn an AI-generation disclosure into the MP4 at any timestamp. In particular, the finished video must not display `本视频含AI生成/合成内容，非真实影像`, `本视频含AI生成画面与AI合成配音`, or equivalent AI-disclosure wording. Satisfy any platform disclosure requirement only through the platform's publication setting, declaration field, or publication copy; do not render it into the opening, body, captions, ending, or cover.
- For WeChat Channels formal publication, require positive machine-verifiable evidence that the original-content declaration is active and the platform declaration `含有AI生成内容` (or the current exact equivalent) is selected. If either control is missing, cannot be selected, or cannot be verified, stop before the publish click and preserve a diagnostic screenshot; never fall back to `无需声明`, `不声明`, or an unchecked original state.
- Preserve all candidates, adopted titles, formula traceability, topic-set recommendation reasons, and the resolved adopted publication topics in `titles.json`.
- Require every `L01–L10` long-title candidate to contain 20–40 Chinese Han characters, excluding punctuation, Latin letters, digits, and spaces from that count. Build each candidate by naturally combining 2–3 distinct `dbs-xhs-title` formula angles and 3–6 non-repeated search/recommendation keywords grounded in the verified book, confirmed narration, audience problem, emotion, action, or outcome. Vary formula combinations and keyword emphasis across the 10 candidates; reject keyword stuffing, duplicated clauses, unsupported promises, and titles that read like a tag list.
- Require every `S01–S10` short-title candidate to contain at least eight Chinese Han characters, excluding punctuation, Latin letters, digits, and spaces from that minimum count. Prefer 8–12 Chinese characters, keep the existing 16-character cap, and regenerate any candidate that fails the minimum before automatic adoption or user display.
- Make the complete 10+10+10 selection set user-visible in the current conversation as soon as automatic selection finishes. A file path alone, candidate counts alone, or only the adopted items are insufficient.
- Generate exactly 10 publication-topic sets. Each set must contain exactly seven unique, space-separated hashtags, always include `#读书`, `#好书推荐`, and the resolved `#《当前书名》`, and use four narration-relevant topics for the remaining positions. Automatically adopt `T01`.

## Supporting skills and tools

- Use `dbs-content` for reference-copy diagnosis, not derivative drafting.
- Use `weread-skills` for edition verification and popular highlights.
- After WeRead records `no_matching_book`, use `scripts/lookup_douban_book.py` for a bounded single-title metadata lookup. Preserve all candidates and source URLs; honor explicit edition identifiers, otherwise default same-book edition selection to the uniquely latest reliable publication date before downloading a cover, and follow `references/douban-book-fallback.md`.
- Use `dbs-xhs-title` for traceable title formulas.
- Use the workbench GPT Image 2 API-kit provider for original storyboard images, style-conditioned G04 images, revisions, and generated cover backgrounds. Load the key only at runtime from the configured kit file.
- Use `media-publish-check` for C01 and C02.
- Use local VoxCPM for locked narration and FFmpeg for assembly, audio, captions, and validation.
- Use the pinned `dreammis/social-auto-upload` adapter only through the workbench. Draft mode remains draft-only; formal multi-platform publication requires an explicit per-task authorization token and selected accounts.
- Use the bundled scripts for project initialization, variant resolution, voice tests, mixing, cover composition, Feishu sync, and delivery validation.

## Completion handoff

Do not call production complete until required evidence, a passing O01 report on every normal derivative run, the two confirmations, passing or explicitly disclosed validation, final media, standalone cover, and delivery manifest exist.

In the final handoff:

- link the MP4, cover, validation reports, and `titles.json`;
- repeat the adopted long title, short title, and publication-topic set, and keep the complete 10+10+10 candidate document linked;
- show the adopted publication topics as one copy-ready line;
- expose missing or low-confidence items;
- report Feishu state when enabled;
- distinguish completed production from optional draft upload, pending publication authorization, automatic publication results, and analytics review.
