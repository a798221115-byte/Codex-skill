## Video

- Canvas: 9:16.
- Resolution: 1080x1920.
- Frame rate: 60fps.
- Video codec: H.264 High, yuv420p.
- Audio: AAC, 48kHz.
- Visual speed: 1.00x unless explicitly changed.

### Still-image motion

- Each storyboard image receives exactly one motion: `zoom-out`, `zoom-in`, `pan-left-to-right`, or `pan-right-to-left`.
- `zoom-out` is centered and monotonically decreases from 120% to 100%. `zoom-in` is centered and monotonically increases from 100% to 120%.
- Both pan motions remain at a fixed 120% scale for edge coverage and move in only one direction. They must not zoom, reverse, expose a black edge, or move outside the frame.
- Select motions with a deterministic pseudo-random seed. Exclude the immediately preceding motion before selecting the next one, so adjacent storyboard images never repeat the same motion while rerenders stay reproducible.
- Treat eight seconds as the approved reference pace and normalize the easing over the actual narration-aligned image hold.
- Use monotonic smoothstep easing, calculate at a 2x working resolution, then Lanczos-downscale to 1080x1920 at 60fps. Do not use sinusoidal crop coordinates or any expression that reverses direction within one shot.

### Standard typography baseline

Use these rendered canvas字号 for standard videos unless the user explicitly overrides them:

| Element | Size |
| --- | ---: |
| Book title | 88 |
| Author name | 48 |
| Chinese captions | 68 |
| English captions | 30 |

Color hierarchy: book title is light orange; author name is light blue.

Keep one-line caption layout and safe-area spacing.

Lock the standard bilingual caption placement to the previously approved 1080×1920 baseline:

| Caption | ASS alignment | MarginV |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Chinese | bottom center (`2`) | 560 |
| English | bottom center (`2`) | 510 |

Render Chinese and English as two independent ASS styles with identical time boundaries. Do not combine them into a single style with `\N`, and do not substitute a lower bottom margin. These values are production defaults and may change only when the user explicitly requests a different position.

## Locked narration

The history-track production default is `male`, resolved to `history-scholar-male-locked-v1`. Use `female` only when the user explicitly requests it.

Narration starts after C01 copy compliance passes, in parallel with automatic long/short title generation and selection. Store every completed segment's measured start/end immediately, update `recipe.json` and storyboard timing fields, and use those values as the caption and image-hold authority. G03 must wait for this real timeline.

Read the selected project preset before generation. Both variants use VoxCPM2 / `openbmb/VoxCPM2`, CFG 2.0, 20 inference steps, fixed seed 42 for every segment, normalize false, denoise false, and retry bad case false. Generate natively first, then apply the configured pitch-preserving tempo only when the configured speech speed is not `1.00x`.

### 历史讲述旁白默认

- 默认使用 `measured-history-lecture` 语气：0.96× 保音调放缓，书名后停顿 1.6 秒，普通段落后停顿 0.55–0.65 秒，结尾停顿 0.35 秒。
- 在生成成片前验证实际时间轴中的 `speechSpeed` 与停顿参数；若没有读取项目预设或误用女性成长赛道的 `gentle-reflective` 参数，视为配置错误并阻断渲染。
- 口播文本只可在不改变字词、事实、引文边界和文案含义的前提下，增加自然的逗号、句号和省略停顿，服务于呼吸、情绪递进和落句；保存这份仅供配音的韵律稿供审计。
- 对每段真实完成配音重新测时，并以重测后的时长更新字幕、分镜停留和成片时间轴；不得沿用变速前时长。
- 用户明确要求更快、更慢、更强或更克制的表达时，以用户指令覆盖这组默认值，并记录覆盖参数。

### 历史学者型合成男声

- Preset: `assets/voice-presets/history-scholar-male-locked-v1.json`.
- Bundled preset: `assets/history-scholar-male-locked-v1.json`.
- Reference: `male-podcast-locked-v2-reference.wav`.
- Golden master: `male-podcast-locked-v2-full.wav`.
- Reference mode: `reference_only`; do not invent or pass prompt text.
- This is the history-track default variant. It is an original synthetic narrator role, not 王立群本人 and not an authorized imitation. Never use `王立群.mp3` or another identifiable real-person recording as its reference, and never claim endorsement or authentic speech.

### 女版音色

- Preset: `assets/voice-presets/female-book-narrator-locked-v1.json`.
- Bundled preset: `assets/female-book-narrator-locked-v1.json`.
- Reference: `female-book-narrator-locked-v1-reference.wav`.
- Prompt transcript: `female-book-narrator-locked-v1-transcript.txt`.
- Golden master: `female-book-narrator-locked-v1-full.wav`.
- Reference mode: `prompt_and_reference`; pass the bundled prompt audio and exact bundled transcript together.
- Reference pitch median: about 143.71 Hz; ordinary pause target: 0.38 seconds; reference gross pace: about 4.52 Chinese characters/second.
- This is the optional variant for the history track. Use it with the matching female intro only when the user explicitly requests the female version.

Never substitute references, modes, seeds, or mastering chains between variants. If project copies are missing, restore the selected bundled preset and all assets it names, then verify SHA-256 hashes against the preset.

## Voice and intro variant binding

Resolve one production variant before narration, caption timing, or mixing:

| Variant | Voice preset | Fixed intro | Expected duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `male` | `history-scholar-male-locked-v1` (`历史学者型合成男声`) | `固定/男版前3秒固定开头.mp4` (`男版片头`) | 2.97 seconds |
| `female` | `female-book-narrator-locked-v1` (`女版音色`) | `固定/女版前3秒固定开头.mp4` (`女版片头`) | 2.97 seconds |

Use `male` as the history-track default when the user has not selected a variant. When the user requests the female version, resolve both voice and intro to `female`. Verify the intro file hash from `assets/default-config.json`, retain its original audio, and use its measured duration as the narration and caption offset. Treat a voice/intro mismatch as a blocking validation error unless the user explicitly authorizes cross-pairing. Do not overlay subtitles or other new text on the fixed opening three seconds unless the user explicitly asks for it. Never overlay or burn AI-generation notices anywhere in the finished MP4, including `本视频含AI生成画面与AI合成配音`; the platform's publication-page AI disclosure remains a separate manual action and must not be implemented as video or cover text.

## Deterministic header placement

Read the fixed `读书分享` / book-title / author header positions from `captions.typography.headerPositionsPx`. For the standard 1080×1920 canvas, shift the complete header group down by 10% of canvas height (192px) from the former 95 / 165 / 275px baseline. The default top offsets are therefore 287px for the column label, 357px for the book title, and 467px for the author. Preserve the three lines' internal spacing and apply any future position override to the complete group rather than moving one line independently.

## Approved final mix

Music baseline:

- Intro: 0.63.
- Body: 0.63.
- Fade-out: final 1.0 second.

For `历史学者型合成男声`, apply body voice clarity in two deterministic stages:

1. `volume=0.60,highpass=f=70,lowpass=f=13500,acompressor=threshold=0.10:ratio=1.6:attack=12:release=140:makeup=1.20,loudnorm=I=-12.5:LRA=2:TP=-1.0`
2. `volume=1.14,alimiter=limit=0.86:level=false`

Approved decoded pure-voice targets are approximately -12.4 LUFS, LRA 2.5 LU, and -0.8dBFS true peak. Do not add presence EQ merely to make the waveform brighter; the approved clarity comes from the v2 reference clone at native speed.

For `女版音色`, use the user-approved `soft-v2` mastering chain stored in `female-book-narrator-locked-v1.json`. This changes only post-generation mastering; keep the locked reference audio, prompt transcript, VoxCPM2 parameters, fixed seed, native generated timing, and voice/intro binding unchanged:

1. `highpass=f=65,lowpass=f=12000,equalizer=f=250:t=q:w=1.0:g=1.0,equalizer=f=3200:t=q:w=1.15:g=-2.0,acompressor=threshold=0.15:ratio=1.2:attack=25:release=220:makeup=1.0,loudnorm=I=-15.5:LRA=10:TP=-1.5`
2. `volume=1.25,alimiter=limit=0.88:level=false`

Use final-mix limiter `0.90` and final-mix gain `1.00` for the female profile. The intent is a rounder, warmer narration with less 3.2kHz hardness and gentler compression; do not restore the former +1.5dB presence boost or 1.4:1 compressor unless the user explicitly requests the brighter legacy treatment.

Do not apply the male mastering chain to the female preset or vice versa.

Ducking:

- Threshold: 0.018.
- Ratio: 4.
- Attack: 10ms.
- Release: 220ms.
- Final limiter: 0.90 with auto-level disabled.

These are baseline values derived from the approved benchmark comparison. Re-measure when the narration source changes materially.

## Validation

Check:

- exact duration and stream properties;
- first body frame/caption after intro;
- no duplicate opener;
- intro audio exists;
- BGM audibility and ducking;
- decoded peak no higher than about -0.8dBFS;
- final one-second music fade;
- one-line captions and forbidden punctuation;
- image and audio paths;
- sample frames at the intro boundary, middle, and ending.
- no burned-in AI-generation disclosure at the opening, body, ending, or cover; platform AI declaration is tracked separately as publication metadata or a publication-page action;
- a passing C02 media report before automatic G06 delivery registration and any draft or formal upload;
- draft-only mode for G07, selected account, and idempotency record;
- explicit per-task authorization, selected platform accounts, platform-appropriate cover handling, and per-target idempotency records before G08 formal publication;
- for WeChat Channels, a fail-closed pre-publish screenshot proving both the original declaration and `含有AI生成内容` platform declaration were selected; no proof means no publish click;
- success detection and a durable per-platform result for every automatic publication attempt.

## Approved standalone cover

- The approved cover is a standalone 1080x1260 (6:7) upload asset.
- Preserve the verified original cover artwork and typography; generated imagery may only extend the surrounding background.
- After automated cover validation, do not create a 1080x1920 cover frame, insert a silent clip, shift the existing video/audio, regenerate narration, alter captions, or update `recipe.json`.
- Validate the cover dimensions, central safe area, original-cover hash, legibility, and manifest path. Any later embedding or distribution work is a separate explicitly requested workflow.
